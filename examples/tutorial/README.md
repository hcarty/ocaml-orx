# Ports of the Orx tutorials

Orx comes with several tutorial programs in its source distribution. This
directory has ports to Reason/OCaml of those tutorials.

These are relatively direct ports of the zlib-licensed Orx tutorials. See
`LICENSE.orx` for the Orx license the Orx C tutorials are distributed under.
